# Eric's dotfiles

My dotfiles! :D I use these to customize my terminal wherever I go.

# Wat?!

Lots of `terminal` applications use a `.application_name_rc` as their configuration file. These are usually stored under the user's home directory, though sometimes stored elsewhere.

I have placed my configurations here so that I can replication my terminal/computing environment in the computers that I use.
